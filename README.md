pigGame
A number game where the winner is the player who is able to reach the score of 100 points by rolling a die. This project manipulates the HTML elements, as well as pictures of the dice shown on the interface to reflect the random number between 1 to 6 that is generated by the player rolling the dice. This project also uses Javascript to keep track of the numbers generated by the players.
